# Hi, I'm Ayman Mohammad 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a student at **The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD)** with a strong interest in **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **research**. I enjoy exploring how data, intelligent systems, and thoughtful design can come together to solve real-world problems.

I love working across the stack — from **web development** and **ML/AI** to **data analysis** and **product thinking** — and I’m especially excited about:

- 🤖 Building ML/AI-powered applications  
- 📊 Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- 🌐 Developing impactful web experiences  
- 🧪 Exploring research ideas at the intersection of AI and Medicine.

Collaboration is a big part of how I work: I enjoy teaming up with people from different backgrounds to turn ideas into something meaningful and useful.

## ⚽ Hobbies

- 🏈 **Football** – Played for my high school team (JV legends rise up 😤) and in a couple of competitive leagues  
- 🏀 **Basketball** – Still pretty good (depending on the day and who you ask), still trying to perfect the jumper while occasionally perfecting the art of missing  
- ⛳ **Golf** – Chasing that one perfect shot that keeps me coming back after 17 questionable ones
